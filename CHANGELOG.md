# Changelog

All notable changes to Cabrero are documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `cabrero prompts` — list prompt files with name, version, last-modified time,
  and path to the prompt file on disk.
- `cabrero replay` — re-run pipeline on past sessions with alternate prompt files.
  Supports `--stage` (classifier/evaluator, inferred from filename), `--compare`
  for diffing against original decisions, `--calibration` for batch regression
  testing against the calibration set, and model/timeout overrides.
- `cabrero calibrate` — manage calibration set for prompt regression testing.
  Subcommands: `tag` (with `--label approve|reject` and optional `--note`),
  `untag`, and `list`.
- `~/.cabrero/replays/` directory for replay output persistence (meta.json,
  classifier.json, evaluator.json per replay).
- `~/.cabrero/calibration.json` for calibration set storage.
- `RunClassifierWithPrompt` / `RunEvaluatorWithPrompt` pipeline helpers for
  prompt override without code duplication.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Configurable pipeline models** — classifier and evaluator models are now
  configurable via CLI flags (`--classifier-model`, `--evaluator-model`) on `run`,
  `backfill`, and `daemon` commands, and via `config.json` (`classifierModel`,
  `evaluatorModel`). Resolution: CLI flag → config.json → compile-time default.
- `cabrero status` shows active pipeline models and prompt versions.
- `cabrero doctor` reports active pipeline models under Pipeline diagnostics.
- `cabrero run` prints active model names before pipeline execution.
- TUI pipeline monitor shows a MODELS section with override detection.

### Changed

- `cabrero backfill` preview derives model names from configuration instead of
  hardcoded prose.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Token usage tracking in pipeline history** — each run history record now captures
  per-stage token consumption, cost, and CC session IDs via `--output-format json`
  from the `claude` CLI. New `InvocationUsage` struct records input/output tokens,
  cache creation/read tokens, cost, turn count, and web search/fetch request counts.
  Per-stage fields (`classifier_usage`, `evaluator_usage`) and totals
  (`total_cost_usd`, `total_input_tokens`, `total_output_tokens`) are added to
  `HistoryRecord`. Batch evaluator usage is split equally among sessions in the chunk.
  Usage is captured even on CC-level errors for partial observability.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Pipeline run history** — append-only JSONL log (`~/.cabrero/run_history.jsonl`)
  captures full diagnostic context for every pipeline run: actual wall-clock timing
  per stage, invocation source (daemon/CLI/backfill), batch context, models and
  prompt versions used, config snapshot, and error details. Replaces unreliable
  mtime-based timing estimates in the TUI. Records rotated after 90 days on daemon
  startup. Includes `ComputeStatsFromHistory` for aggregate analysis (median/p95
  latency, evaluator skip rate, retry rate, source breakdown).

- **Debug mode indicator** — `cabrero status`, the dashboard header, and the
  pipeline monitor DAEMON section now show "Debug: enabled" in warning color
  when pipeline debug mode is active. Hidden when off.

- **Scoped filesystem access for pipeline invocations** — Classifier and evaluator
  CC sessions now use `--permission-mode dontAsk`, `--setting-sources ""`, and
  path-scoped `--allowedTools` to restrict filesystem access. The classifier can
  only read `~/.cabrero/`; the evaluator can read `~/.cabrero/`, the session's
  project directory, and `~/.claude/`. Prevents CC from loading user plugins and
  eliminates remaining macOS TCC prompt triggers.

### Fixed

- **macOS network volume TCC prompts** — `claude` child processes inherited
  `cwd=/` from the launchd daemon, causing CC's startup project discovery to
  probe paths reaching the Google Drive FileProvider. Now sets `cmd.Dir` to
  `~/.cabrero/` for a safe, local-only starting directory.

- **False queue-drain notification** — daemon sent "Queue processing complete"
  even when new sessions arrived during processing. Now re-scans after the
  batch and only notifies when the queue is truly empty.

- **Apply workflow hardening** — `apply.Blend` sets `cmd.Dir` to prevent macOS
  TCC prompts; `apply.Commit` validates proposal targets (rejects non-`.md` and
  path traversal) and uses atomic writes; `truncateForLog` uses rune slicing for
  UTF-8 correctness; import batch-reads blocklist once; hook scripts escape
  backslashes/quotes in `SESSION_CWD`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Working directory in session metadata** — hook scripts now extract the `cwd`
  field from Claude Code's JSON payload and store it as `work_dir` in
  `metadata.json`. This records the actual filesystem path the session ran in,
  providing more reliable project identification than the CC project slug alone.
- **Pipeline debug mode** — `--debug` flag on `cabrero run` and `cabrero daemon`
  persists full CC session transcripts for classifier/evaluator invocations.
  Pre-assigns a session ID via `--session-id`, immediately blocklists it to
  prevent stale recovery, and logs CLI args and session ID for cross-reference.
  Also togglable at runtime via `{"debug": true}` in `~/.cabrero/config.json`
  (re-read each poll cycle, no daemon restart needed).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Daemon can't find claude CLI** — LaunchAgent PATH is now built dynamically
  during setup, including the directory where the `claude` binary is installed
  (e.g., `~/.local/bin`). Previously hardcoded to system paths only, causing all
  pipeline runs to fail with "executable file not found in $PATH".
- **macOS network volume access prompts** — session scanning (import and stale
  recovery) replaced unbounded `filepath.Walk` with targeted `os.ReadDir` at the
  two known levels where JSONL files exist. No longer descends into
  `tool-results/` or other subdirectories that triggered macOS file provider
  dialogs.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **CLI color output** — all CLI commands (setup, doctor, uninstall, status) now
  use colored output via a shared `internal/cli` package with lipgloss adaptive
  colors. Green checkmarks, orange warnings, red errors, purple accents, bold
  labels, and muted metadata for a consistent visual vocabulary.
- **`uninstall --dry-run`** — preview what uninstall would remove without
  touching anything. Each step shows "Would ..." messages with purple arrows.
- **`make install` symlink** — install target now symlinks the binary to
  `/usr/local/bin/cabrero` for immediate PATH access without shell config
  changes.

### Fixed

- **Binary killed on macOS** — `make install` now re-signs the binary with
  `codesign -s -` after copying to `~/.cabrero/bin/`, preventing macOS
  AppleSystemPolicy from killing the binary due to an invalidated ad-hoc
  code signature.
- **PATH check false negative** — setup and doctor PATH checks now use
  `exec.LookPath` instead of scanning `$PATH` entries, correctly detecting
  the binary when reachable via symlink (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/cabrero`).
- **Tilde in export hint** — PATH suggestions now use `$HOME` instead of
  literal `~` which doesn't expand inside quoted strings.

### Changed

- From-source install instructions in README expanded with PATH/symlink
  guidance.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- **Runner struct** — unified `Run()` and `BatchProcessor` into a single `Runner`
  struct with `RunOne()` and `RunGroup()` methods. Consistent status marking via
  `store.MarkProcessed`/`MarkError`, context cancellation on all paths, and full
  testability via hook fields.

### Removed

- `Run()`, `RunThroughClassifier()`, and `BatchProcessor` — replaced by `Runner`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Pipeline Logger interface** — `pipeline.Logger` with `Info`/`Error` methods,
  injectable via `PipelineConfig.Logger`. Defaults to `stdLogger` (stdout/stderr)
  for backwards compatibility. Includes `discardLogger` for silent operation.
- **Daemon pipeline log routing** — daemon now wires a `daemonPipelineLogger`
  adapter so pipeline progress and warnings appear in `daemon.log` with
  timestamps and `[INFO]`/`[ERROR]` prefixes instead of leaking to
  stdout/stderr.

### Fixed

- **Pipeline stdout/stderr leaks** — all 25 direct `fmt.Printf`/`Println`/
  `Fprintf(os.Stderr)` calls in the pipeline package now route through the
  Logger interface. Fixes output corruption when running under the daemon or
  future TUI integration.
- **Proposal ID mismatch** — batch evaluator `shortID` now returns 6 chars to
  match the evaluator prompt format. Added zero-match guard to detect silent
  proposal drops during partitioning.
- **Non-atomic store writes** — metadata, blocklist, proposals, evaluations, and
  archive writes now use temp file + rename via `store.AtomicWrite` to prevent
  partial writes on crash.
- **Path traversal in proposals** — `ReadProposal` and `WriteProposal` now
  validate proposal IDs against path separators and directory traversal.
- **UTF-8 truncation** — `Truncate`, `TruncatePad`, `TruncateID`, and `PadRight`
  now operate on runes instead of bytes, preventing mid-character splits.
- **Blocklist I/O in loops** — `ScanQueued` and `ScanStale` now pre-load the
  blocklist once instead of reading from disk per session.

### Changed

- `ScanStale` uses `filepath.WalkDir` instead of `filepath.Walk` for lower
  allocation overhead.
- `reject` command uses `flag.NewFlagSet` instead of manual flag parsing.
- Session status strings replaced with typed constants (`store.StatusQueued`,
  `store.StatusImported`, `store.StatusProcessed`, `store.StatusError`).
- `ScanQueued` uses `slices.Reverse` instead of manual loop.

### Removed

- Dead functions: `GetAgentTranscript`, `GetSessionRange`, `ListPipelineRuns`,
  `GatherPipelineStats`, `ListProjects`.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Text wrapping** — fitness report verdict and proposal detail rationale now
  word-wrap instead of truncating at the terminal edge. New `WrapIndent` helper
  in `shared/format.go`.
- **Dashboard empty state** — status bar no longer shows approve/reject/defer
  keys when there are no items to act on.
- **Fitness header overflow** — ownership/origin line splits onto two lines at
  widths below 100 to prevent horizontal overflow.
- **Dashboard narrow header** — daemon status and hooks now stack onto separate
  lines in standard/narrow layout instead of overflowing.
- **Evidence pluralization** — "(1 entries)" corrected to "(1 entry)".
- **Pipeline status bar anchoring** — status bar now stays pinned to the bottom
  of the terminal instead of floating after the last section.
- **Tab toggle on hidden chat** — Tab key in detail view no longer toggles focus
  to an invisible chat panel at narrow widths; messages are no longer forwarded
  to the chat model when the panel is hidden.
- **Detail status bar** — "tab next pane" hint hidden when chat panel is not
  visible.
- **Pipeline cursor preservation** — auto-refresh no longer resets cursor and
  expansion state every 5 seconds.
- **Snapshot CLI flag parsing** — flags now work after the view name
  (e.g., `snapshot dashboard -w 80`).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **TUI snapshot pipeline** — `cmd/snapshot` renders all TUI views to ANSI
  stdout. Pipe through [freeze](https://github.com/charmbracelet/freeze) via
  `make snapshots` (all views) or `make snapshot VIEW=<name>` (single view)
  to produce SVG and PNG files with catppuccin-mocha styling. PNGs capped at
  1200px width.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **`cabrero review`** — interactive Bubble Tea TUI for reviewing proposals.
  Dashboard shows proposal list with type indicators, confidence, and sort/filter.
  Detail view renders colored unified diffs, rationale, and citation chains.
  Stack-based navigation with configurable arrow or vim keybinding modes.
- **AI chat panel** — streaming Evaluator integration via `claude` CLI for
  interrogating proposals before deciding. Question chips for common queries,
  revision detection via ` ```revision ` fenced blocks.
- **`cabrero approve`** — non-interactive CLI command that reads a proposal,
  invokes Claude to blend the change into the target file, shows a before/after
  diff, and writes the file on confirmation.
- **`cabrero reject`** — non-interactive CLI command that archives a proposal
  with an optional rejection reason (`--reason "text"`).
- **Fitness Report Detail view** — assessment bars showing three-bucket health
  breakdown (followed/worked around/confused), expandable session evidence grouped
  by category, dismiss and jump-to-sources actions. Fitness reports appear in the
  dashboard with `◎` indicator alongside proposals.
- **Source Manager** — grouped source list organized by origin (user, project,
  plugin) with collapsible sections. Ownership classification, iterate/evaluate
  approach toggles with confirmation gates, change history detail with rollback
  support. Adaptive column layout for different terminal widths.
- **Dashboard mixed item list** — unified list showing both proposals and fitness
  reports. `s` keyboard shortcut opens Source Manager from dashboard.
- **TUI configuration** — `~/.cabrero/config.json` with navigation mode,
  theme, dashboard sort order, chat panel width, personality flavor text,
  and per-action confirmation toggles. Partial configs merge with defaults.
- **Pipeline monitor view** — daemon health, recent runs with per-stage timing
  breakdown (parse/classifier/evaluator), sparkline activity chart, prompt
  version listing, inline run detail expansion, and retry flow with
  configurable confirmation gate.
- **Pipeline monitor daemon header** — uptime, poll/stale/delay intervals, store
  metrics (path, session count, disk usage), and two-column layout at width >= 120.
- **Log viewer view** — full-screen scrollable daemon log with incremental
  search, match navigation (n/N), follow mode toggle, and auto-refresh via
  polling.
- **Log viewer search highlighting** — search matches highlighted with accent
  color in the viewport using termenv styling.
- **Log viewer two-stage Esc** — first Esc clears active search matches and
  highlighting, second Esc navigates back to the pipeline monitor.
- **PipelineRun data layer** — reconstructs pipeline run history from store
  artifacts (session metadata, classifier/evaluator output files, timestamps)
  without requiring a dedicated database.
- **Sparkline component** — Unicode block-character sparkline renderer for
  visualizing sessions-per-day activity in the pipeline monitor.
- **Polling auto-refresh** — pipeline monitor refreshes every 5 seconds, log
  viewer refreshes every 1 second when follow mode is active.
- **PipelineConfig settings** — configurable sparkline days, recent runs limit,
  and log follow mode default via `shared.Config`.
- **Pipeline monitor responsive layout** — three-tier layout (wide/standard/narrow)
  adapts daemon header density, activity stats format, sparkline visibility,
  run row detail level, and prompt section visibility to terminal width.

### Fixed

- Chat panel now streams tokens in real-time instead of buffering.
- Chat panel renders alongside detail view in wide terminals.
- Dashboard approve/reject/defer navigates to detail view first.
- Reject and defer actions respect per-action confirmation config toggles.
- Personality flavor text from config is now honored in TUI messages.
- Review flow subprocess isolation hardened to prevent Bubble Tea contract
  violations.
- Fire-and-forget archive goroutines replaced with proper `tea.Cmd` to prevent
  races.
- Config saves no longer strip the `pipeline` section from `config.json`.
- Sparkline bucketing normalizes timestamps to local timezone for correct day
  boundaries.

### Changed

- Log viewer uses incremental reading in follow mode for lower I/O overhead.
- Pipeline monitor deduplicates redundant store reads per tick.
- Consolidated duplicated TUI utilities, styles, and dead code.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- `cabrero backfill` command to process existing sessions through the full
  pipeline with `--since`, `--until`, `--project`, `--retry-errors` filtering,
  preview with confirmation, and smart batching via `pipeline.BatchProcessor`.
- Setup wizard Step 8: offers to import and enqueue existing CC sessions after
  installation (imports in quiet mode, counts imported, offers to enqueue for
  background processing with configurable lookback — default 1 month, skippable).
- `store.QuerySessions` for filtered session queries by date range, project
  substring, and status. Returns oldest-first.
- `pipeline.BatchProcessor` as shared smart batching infrastructure with
  configurable max batch size (default 10) and progress callbacks. Used by
  both daemon and backfill command.
- `backfill --enqueue` flag to mark sessions as queued for background daemon
  processing instead of running the pipeline synchronously.
- `store.MarkQueued()` function for transitioning sessions to queued status.
- Daemon notification when queue processing completes.

### Changed

- Renamed session status `pending` to `queued` for hook-captured sessions.
- Imported sessions now use `imported` status (not automatically processed
  by daemon).
- Daemon scanner simplified: filters on `queued` status only, no longer
  checks capture trigger.
- Setup wizard backfill step now uses `--enqueue` for non-blocking processing.
- Doctor check updated: warns about sessions stuck in `queued` status >24h.
- `cabrero import` now runs the pre-parser on each imported session to generate
  digests. `RunImport` function available for programmatic use (quiet mode).
- Daemon batching logic refactored into `pipeline.BatchProcessor` (no behavior
  change).
- `store.MarkProcessed` and `store.MarkError` extracted as public helpers.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- **Agentic evaluators** — Classifier and Evaluator now run in
  agentic mode with Read/Grep tool access instead of single-shot `--print`.
  Classifier can verify ambiguous signals by reading raw JSONL turns (scoped to
  `~/.cabrero/raw/`). Evaluator can read current skill files and CLAUDE.md to
  inform proposals (unrestricted filesystem access). Both have prompt-based
  turn budgets and wall-clock timeouts.
- **Triage gate** — Classifier now outputs a `triage` field (`"evaluate"` or
  `"clean"`). Clean sessions skip the Evaluator entirely, reducing
  cost for sessions with no actionable signals.
- **Smart batching** — daemon groups pending sessions by project, runs Classifier
  individually (cheap triage), then batches sessions flagged as "evaluate"
  into a single Evaluator invocation per project. Gives Evaluator cross-session
  context within one call while keeping Classifier independent.
- **Prompt versions** — Classifier upgraded to v3 (`classifier-v3.txt`),
  Evaluator upgraded to v3 (`evaluator-v3.txt`).
- **Model-agnostic naming** — renamed "Haiku classifier" → "Classifier" and
  "Sonnet evaluator" → "Evaluator" throughout the codebase, CLI flags, file
  suffixes, and documentation. Decouples pipeline stage names from the Claude
  models that back them. CLI flags renamed: `--haiku-*` → `--classifier-*`,
  `--sonnet-*` → `--evaluator-*`. Output files renamed: `*-haiku.json` →
  `*-classifier.json`, `*-sonnet.json` → `*-evaluator.json`.

### Added

- **CLI flags** — `--classifier-max-turns`, `--evaluator-max-turns`, `--classifier-timeout`,
  `--evaluator-timeout` on both `cabrero daemon` and `cabrero run` for tuning
  agentic evaluator limits.
- **`cabrero uninstall`** — clean removal command that reverses setup: stops
  daemon, removes LaunchAgent, unregisters Claude Code hooks, deletes hook
  scripts and binary. Prompts whether to keep `~/.cabrero` data for
  reinstallation or remove everything. `--yes` skips confirmations,
  `--keep-data`/`--remove-data` control data directory without prompting.
- **`cabrero doctor`** — comprehensive diagnostic command that checks store,
  hook scripts, Claude Code integration, LaunchAgent, daemon, PATH, and
  pipeline health. Reports issues with severity (pass/warn/fail) and offers
  auto-fix for stale hooks, missing registrations, broken LaunchAgent, and
  stopped daemon. `--fix` auto-fixes without prompting, `--json` for scripted
  usage.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-20

First tagged release. Covers Phases 0–3.5 of the design.

### Added

- **Capture layer** — `PreCompact` and `SessionEnd` hook scripts back up CC
  transcripts to `~/.cabrero/raw/` with metadata and loop prevention
- **Store** — `~/.cabrero/` directory layout with raw backups, digests,
  evaluations, proposals, prompts, and session ID blocklist
- **Pre-parser** — JSONL → structured digest with citations, compaction
  segments, error attribution, and friction signals (empty search results,
  search fumbles, backtracking)
- **Cross-session pattern aggregator** — detects recurring errors and
  error-prone tool sequences across 3+ project sessions
- **Classifier** (v2 prompt) — goal inference, error classification,
  key turn selection, skill/CLAUDE.md signal assessment, pattern assessment
- **Evaluator** (v2 prompt) — proposal generation with citation
  validation and `skill_scaffold` proposals for recurring patterns
- **Background daemon** — `cabrero daemon` polls for pending sessions, runs
  pipeline, sends macOS notifications, with stale session recovery, PID-based
  single instance, graceful shutdown, and file logging with rotation
- **LaunchAgent** plist template for auto-start on login
- **CLI commands** — `run`, `sessions`, `status`, `proposals`, `inspect`,
  `import`, `daemon`, `setup`, `update`
- **`cabrero setup`** — interactive wizard: prerequisite checks, store init,
  hook installation from embedded scripts, Claude Code hook registration,
  LaunchAgent install, daemon start, PATH check (`--yes`, `--dry-run`)
- **`cabrero update`** — self-update from GitHub Releases with SHA256
  checksum verification and atomic binary replacement (`--check`)
- **Install script** — `install.sh` for curl-pipe-bash one-liner distribution
- **Build infrastructure** — goreleaser config (darwin/amd64 + darwin/arm64),
  GitHub Actions release workflow on tag push, Makefile for local dev
- **Hook scripts embedded** in binary via `//go:embed`

### Fixed

- Import uses original file timestamps and tracks project metadata
- Store preserves hyphens in project display names
- Session-end hook always overwrites transcript (superset of pre-compact)
- Parser attributes errors to tool names and increments ErrorCount
- Parser emits `[]` instead of `null` for empty slices
- Pipeline disables skills and tools in LLM invocations
